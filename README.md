# üìù Personal Blog API

This is a backend for a blog that no one asked for ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs an overengineered playground to
break stuff, fix it, and pretend you're doing real work. Built with **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **Docker** and
**MySQL**, this project is my sandbox for diving deep into Spring Boot app setup, managing dependencies,
configuring Spring Security, and mastering Docker Compose ‚Äî all under the noble banner of 'learning by shipping,'

Overengineered? Absolutely.
Useful? Debatable.
Fun? Always.

**Relationships:**

- A `User` can author multiple `Posts` (1:N)
- A `Post` can have multiple `Tags` (M:N)
- A `Post` belongs to one `Category` (N:1)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21**
- **Maven 3.x** (or use the included mvnw)
- **Docker** (or MySQL 8+)

### Running the Application

1. **Start the database using Docker Compose**

   Use the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file to start a local MySQL container and Adminer UI
   for development:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Application Configuration**

   The project uses **Spring profiles** to manage environment-specific configuration.

    - The default profile is set to `dev` in [`application.properties`](./src/main/resources/application.properties):

      ```properties
      spring.profiles.active=dev
      ```

    - The `application-dev.properties` file is included in the repository and is preconfigured to match the settings
      used in the Docker Compose setup (e.g., database connection values).

    - To support other environments (e.g., `staging`, `production`), create the corresponding
      `application-<profile>.properties` file with appropriate values. Then either:
        - Update the `spring.profiles.active` property in `application.properties`, or
        - Override it at runtime using the `--spring.profiles.active=<profile>` flag.

3. **Build and Run the App**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Flyway will automatically apply any pending migrations on startup.

4. **Running Tests**

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
